Application: Spendify

Team Overview
The team consists of Eric Trimble @erictrimbs, Alfred Joseph @josephalfred7, and Ariel Simnegar @ariel-simnegar.

Innovative Idea
Spendify is a web interface that gives users opinionated data about their spending with the goal of helping them make better financial decisions. It is roughly similar to Mint.com and other budgeting apps, the difference is that these existing apps are made for budgeting your spending rather than empowering you to save and invest your money by giving you detailed data about where your money from each paycheck is going and what your finances could look like given different investing strategies. It would implement Plaid to let users link their bank and financial accounts, then perform operations on the data in the backend to transform it into a form that we want to display to users. Lastly, we connect the data to html pages to come full-circle and let users access the data.

Important Components
    Our app has some functional requirements. A user needs to log into their account. Next, they need to be able to link their financial data across bank and brokerage accounts. This is handled by linking to Plaid's API. Next, their financial data needs to be served back to them. Bonus points for creating innovative data to serve and for securely accessing and storing data.

Data interaction:
    Users will input data manually and/or pull data from their accounts. The app will process and show data on certain html pages
